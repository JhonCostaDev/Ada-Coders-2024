## What is Data Analisis

* A process of **inspecting**, **cleansing**, **transforming** and **modeling** data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decisions-making.

## Data analisis Tools

    * Auto-managed closed tools:
        ** Qlik
        ** Tableau
        ** Looker
        ** Zoho Analitics

    * Programming Languages:
        ** Python
        ** R
        ** Julia

## Why Python for Data Analysis?

* Very simple and intuitive to learn
* "Correct" language
* Powerful libraries (not just for Data Analysis)
* Free and open sourve
* Amazing comuunity, docs and conferences

## When to choose R?

* When R Studio is needed
* When dealing with advanced statistical methodes
* When extreme performanve is needed

## Data Analysis Process

### Data Extraction
    * SQL
    * Scrapping
    * File Formats
        * CSV
        * JSON
        * XML
    * Consulting APIs
    * Buying Data
    * Distributed Databases

### Data Cleaning
    * Missing values and empty data
    * Data imputation
    * Incorrect or invalid values
    * Outliers and non relevant data
    * Statitical sanitization


### Data Wrangling
    * Hierarchical Data
    * Handling categorical data
    * Reshaping and transforming structures
    * Indexing data for quick access
    * Merging, combining and joining data


### Analysis
    * Exploration
    * Building statistical models
    * Visualization and representations
    * Correlation vs Causation analysis
    * Hypothesis testing
    * Statistical analysis
    * Reporting


### Action
    * Building Machine learning models
    * Feature Engineering
    * Moving ML into production
    * Building ETL pipelines
    * Live dashboard and reporting
    * Decicion making and real-life tests

## Python Ecosystem - The Libraries we use...

* Pandas: The corcenerstone of our Data Analysis job with Python.
* matplotlib: The foundational library for visualizations. Other livbraries we'll use will be built on top of matplotlib.
* Numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.
* Seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.
* Stasmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.
* Scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.
* Scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)
